SonarIssueScoring is a tool for analysing a repository of a software development project.
What you get is a prioritization of SonarQube issues and a prediction which files in a repository will change.

To start a new analysis, you have to click on "Create a project". Just enter the Source Path or URL of your software development project, your username and the URL of your H2O installation, choose a prediction horizon and give it a go.
Previously created projects will be shown on your dashboard for availability at any time.
